        description: "Routes mathematical reasoning between two specialized agents: the **reviewer** (Mathematical Logic Auditor) who rigorously checks solution correctness and flags logical flaws, and the **improver** (Master Mathematician) who revises and perfects solutions based on audit feedback. Call with `next_role='reviewer'` to initiate verification of a proposed solution; call with `next_role='improver'` to refine a solution after receiving audit feedback. Use this tool to enforce a verification-before-finalization workflow for mathematical problems."
